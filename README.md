# Bash Scripts
---

This is a repo containing various Bash scripts I've written for my own personal use. They are free
to use but I will provide no support if you encounter difficulty running them on your system. That
being said, most of them make use of tools found on any Unix distribution so they should 'just
work'. For more information on a particular script, I would inspect the script itself for comments
providing basic documentation regarding configuration and dependencies (if applicable).kk
